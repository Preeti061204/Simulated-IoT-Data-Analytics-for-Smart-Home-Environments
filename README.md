# Simulated-IoT-Data-Analytics-for-Smart-Home-Environments
## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be applied in smart home environments to detect anomalies, forecast energy usage, and evaluate device behavior. Built using a synthetic dataset, the project simulates IoT sensor data like temperature and energy consumption to model real-world scenarios without needing physical devices.
This was a collaborative academic project developed by two contributors as part of a hands-on exploration into data science, analytics, and smart home intelligence.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze synthetic IoT sensor data
- Visualize insights using Power BI and Excel
- Forecast future trends using Prophet
- Compare multiple regression models for predictive accuracy
- Detect anomalies in energy usage patterns

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- *Languages*: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- *Libraries*: 
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn (Regression models)
  - XGBoost, MLPRegressor
  - Prophet (Time series forecasting)
- *Visualization*: Power BI, Excel
- *Environment*: Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Machine Learning Models Applied

We applied the following regression models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## 🔍 Forecasting & Anomaly Detection

- *Prophet* was used for time-series forecasting of energy usage.
- Anomalies in consumption patterns were identified using statistical thresholds and model residuals.
- Findings were visualized using Power BI dashboards for intuitive reporting.
