# Simulated-IoT-Data-Analytics-for-Smart-Home-Environments
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be applied in smart home environments to detect anomalies, forecast energy usage, and evaluate device behavior. Built using a synthetic dataset, the project simulates IoT sensor data like temperature and energy consumption to model real-world scenarios without needing physical devices.
This was a collaborative academic project developed by two contributors as part of a hands-on exploration into data science, analytics, and smart home intelligence.
