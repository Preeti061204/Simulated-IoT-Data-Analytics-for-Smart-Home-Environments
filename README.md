# Simulated-IoT-Data-Analytics-for-Smart-Home-Environments
## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be applied in smart home environments to detect anomalies, forecast energy usage, and evaluate device behavior. Built using a synthetic dataset, the project simulates IoT sensor data like temperature and energy consumption to model real-world scenarios without needing physical devices.
This was a collaborative academic project developed by two contributors as part of a hands-on exploration into data science, analytics, and smart home intelligence.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze synthetic IoT sensor data
- Detect anomalies in energy usage patterns
- Forecast future trends using Prophet
- Compare multiple regression models for predictive accuracy
- Visualize insights using Power BI and Excel
